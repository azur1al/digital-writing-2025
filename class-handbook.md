# CLASS HANDBOOK

## Digital Writing

### With Jenny Hedley and Lucinda Strahan

This studio focuses on electronic/digital writing – that is, writing (poetry, fiction, nonfiction or other) that relies on computation to be realised. This includes computer-generated writing, hypertext and interactive fiction, and digital poetry. We will also look at print precursors that use techniques associated with digital literature (for example, the processes employed by the Oulipo writers). We will explore interactive literary concepts, such as what it means when readers can make choices in a narrative or move the words in a poem, and how to use these techniques to develop or alter your work.

There is no requirement to have any skills in relation to the digital – in other words, you don't need to be a programmer – but you must be willing to challenge yourself and be bold. Over the semester we will read a range of digital literature and there will be opportunities to make works with authoring tools like Twine, which require little knowledge, to writing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. At the end of semester, you will produce either an interactive narrative work or a series of digital poems and understand the processes involved in publishing these works online.

This studio is for those who wish to experiment with their writing practice and take a more conscious approach to the tools with which they write, or those interested in form and its possibilities and constraints.

There will be readings almost every week - more in the early weeks, fewer in the later weeks.

There will also be works of electronic literature to read and present back on in class.

## Assessment Tasks

### Task 1: Individual case study (25%)

3-5 minute presentation and discussion

**Due Week 4 in class on Wednesday 26th March**

Prepare a case study of a work of electronic literature. How does it work? What does it do? How does the reader interact with the piece? What kinds of questions does it raise for you? You should include a detailed analysis of form, to offer your lab group some context, and share with us what you have learnt that might relate to your own practice or potential output.

Your will choose a work from one of the Electronic Literature Collections or, if you have another work in mind, in negotiation with your lab leader. You must select the work by Week 2 and you will have two weeks to read the work and prepare the presentation, to present in Week 4.

You only have 3 minutes, so good organisation, clear focus and well-chosen examples are important here. Support materials are essential - a clear Powerpoint presentation so we can follow along.

Your presentation should briefly address ‘What is conveyed’ by the digital work and tell us something about the artist and where the artist sits in terms of industry or material practice. But you should then spend most of your time asking 'How does it happen?', whatever it is that this digital work does.

Here, you might analyse: how a reader interacts with the work or whether they can; the relationship between imagery and text; how the text changes between readings; how movement acts in the work; the structure of the work; the technologies used; the relationship between space and time in the work (explicit or implicit); the relationship between the work and the browser. Address a few of these ideas, using specific examples in a Powerpoint.

We want to close read electronic literature techniques so we can understand them better.

Please leave the class with 1 question at the end of the talk. The question should be open-ended and meant to make us think about our own practice, making or reading digital literature.

Afterwards, please upload your Powerpoint to Canvas.

### Task 2: Proposal (25%)

5-minute presentation plus materials e.g. draft creative work.

**Due Week 8 in class on Monday 28th April**

Present your creative work-in-progress to an audience of your peers who will provide professional feedback on how to develop your work. This must include an early prototype, a proposal for the final length of the work and at least 4 pages of design or text, presented as a slideshow e.g. Powerpoint, narrated and contextualised by you.

Afterwards, please upload your Powerpoint to Canvas.

### Task 3: Folio including a developed creative work (50%)

Folio of 15-30 pages comprising creative experiments (including screenshots with a links for the digital experiments), professional materials, reflection and a work of electronic literature with a length agreed on by your lab leader.

**Due end of Week 13, by midnight, to TurnItIn/Canvas**

Deliver a folio of the work developed during your lab and an accompanying, formal reflection that engages with the studio, the group, and the development of your work over/through the course of the semester, asking: how does my work fit within the context of my community?

You will be given a range of exercises throughout the semester which will be opportunities for you to test ideas, materials and mediums. You will develop work in response to prompts, restrictions and briefs and present this work in class. This will develop a folio that collects your electronic literature experiments, reflective writing (including some critical writing in response to the work of your peers) and any other documentation of your lab work.

This is a great place to demonstrate the breadth of your engagement - what have you tried and tested and failed at, when working in this medium?

As well as documenting your lab work, the folio should include professional materials discussed throughout the semester. For the digital writing studio, that includes (but doesn't have to be limited to - it's up to you) a link to your GitHub account, an artist's statement and a personal webpage or artist CV.

The folio must include a polished work of electronic literature that you have prepared this semester. This is a complete work, not a prototype, with ideas that have been introduced, developed and resolved. The length of the work will vary depending on the kind of work that you develop so the final length should be proposed in Week 8 and agreed on by your lab leader.
