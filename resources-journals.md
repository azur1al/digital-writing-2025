It is always worth reaching out to online journals when they have calls for submissions. Even if they donâ€™t currently publish electronic literature, they may like your piece enough to publish it.

Also, self-publishing is always an option for digital writing: either on a website you maintain or via sites such as [itch.io](https://itch.io/).
