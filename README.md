## Before Week 1

Read (on top of the weekly readings):
1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
3. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
4. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

## Questions

### Digital Writing

- What do you think digital writing is?
- What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

### Your Writing

- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

### Electronic Literature

- Defining e-lit
- [The Electronic Literature Collections](https://collection.eliterature.org/)
- [Woollahra Digital Literary Award](https://www.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/Library/Digital-literary-award)
  
### Reading

Read a few works from each volume of the [Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/):

* [Volume 1 (October 2006)](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/)
* [Volume 2 (February 2011)](https://collection.eliterature.org/2/)
* [Volume 3 (February 2016)](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/)
* [Volume 4 (June 2022)](https://collection.eliterature.org/4/)

Select one work from each volume that you read and for each write:

* What makes the work a piece of digital writing
* A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel &c)

## GitHub

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Do the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Digital Writing Folio

Create a public repository with a `README` called `digital-writing-folio`.

On the main page of the repository you will see a button called "Add file".

1. Select "Add file"
2. Select "Create new file" from the dropdown that appears
3. At the top where you can see "Name your file..." type in `readings.md`
4. Scroll down to the bottom and select "Commit new file"
5. Repeat the above steps to add `exercises.md`

Look at the [example digital writing folio](https://github.com/blidau/digital-writing-folio). This should give you an idea of what the folio should initially look like.

On the example digital writing folio click on the "README.md". You should see a button that looks like "<>" just above the content. Select that button to see the formatting on the page. You can follow this technique for all the pages if you need to see the formatting used. Also read the reference for [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Edit the `exercises.md` page you just created in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions, you answered earlier.

## Write a Bio Note

Write a 100-word biographical note. Use the questions you answered above as starting points. Add the biographical note to the `README.md` of your GitHub digital writing folio repository.

## Intro to the Coding Playground

- Create an account on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) using your GitHub login credentials
- Remix this code: [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground)

# Week 2 - for use in class

This Wednesday we will be working in the [coding playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground) that you began to remix last week. 

If you missed out on the first week of classes, please make sure that you have set up a GitHub account, have signed into Glitch.com using your GitHub credentials so that the accounts are linked, that you follow the exercises above including Hello World (if you get lost, find a YouTube tutorial) and setting up your Digital Writing folio, that you're familiar with the documentation in this GitHub repository including the [class handbook](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/class-handbook.md), and that you are up to date on the class readings. Also be sure to share your GitHub username with Jenny and Lucinda if you have not done so already.

In class this week we will learn step-by-step how to make changes to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You will learn to import fonts of your choosing into the stylesheet; how to edit text, emojis and images; how to set background colours and apply various style changes. You will also learn how to edit textual arrays in order to fuel combinatory poetry which is pseudo-randomly generated. You are not expected to know how to do any of these things yet. If you have to miss out on this Wednesday class for any reason, then you should spend at least a few hours completing [free coding tutorials](https://github.com/jennyhedley/digital-writing-2025/blob/main/resources-basic-website.md#free-resources-for-learning-web-development) such as Codeacademy and FreeCodeCamp.

Here are some miscellaneous resources that you will find helpful as we code today:

- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Hex colour codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) 
- Check if your [colour contrast is accessible](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- [Royalty-free images](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Emojis](https://tools.picsart.com/text/emojis/)
- [GIFs](https://giphy.com/)
- [ChatGPT for troubleshooting code](https://chat.openai.com/)

# Week 3 - for use in class

This Monday we will finish working in the [coding playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground) which we remixed. In class, we will remix the last three poems, as follows, then publish our coding playgrounds via GitHub Pages. 

It is important that you engage with these exercises, as Jenny and Lucinda will expect to see these published experiments when you submit your folio at the end of semester, which forms half of your marks. It is important to document your learning and your engagement with coding, as you figure out the technical possibilities for what your final project will look like. Even if you choose not to go with HTML/CSS/JS for your project, it is the most basic programming syntax which fuels nearly every online literary journal and is therefore worth being exposed to. If you do not yet have an author website - another requirement of the folio - building one on Glitch and publishing it on GitHub Pages is a simple and free mode of fulfilling this requirement. There will be further opportunities later in the semester to build author sites.

If you are absent from class, be sure to complete the following exercises that we will do in Monday's class:

- The 'Garfield' poem is a form of combinatory poetry that operates within a constraint. In this case, clicking the 'remix' button results in the placeholder text being replaced with three haikus. These haikus are populated from arrays of poetic phrases that are five syllables long - from the `const fiveSyllables =` array in the script.js file - and seven syllables long - from the `const sevenSyllables =` array. Edit these arrays to make haiku of your own, enclosingou will each line of five or seven syllables within parenthesis, followed by a single comma. Next be sure to change the placeholder text in the index.html file in the `<div class="cardHaiku">` area. Also be sure to apply new style properties (font, font colour, background colour, etc.) in the corresponding `.cardHaiku` class on the style.css file. 
- The 'SEARCHING' poem is a way to play with the auto-complete function of a search engine. Inspect your own browser history, or turn to Google or another search engine, to investigate a particular topic. You can either follow your own interests or exploit Google's autocomplete function to create your own database of search results - just make sure that you have at least one result for every letter of the alphabet. You will enclose each line of search results within parenthesis, followed by a single comma, in the `const words =` array on the script.js file. Test it out by typing a single letter in the website preview, in the search box.
- The 'Dystopian Dreams' poem is modified from a digital poetry exercise created by Benjamin Laird, which modified code from Nick Monfort's seminal [Taroko Gorge](https://nickm.com/taroko_gorge/) which has famously been remixed again and again. Under `<div class="cardPoem">` on the index.html file, give the poem a new title. Then on the script.js file, edit the words or phrases within the `const subjects =`, `verbs` and `objects` arrays. Unlike the previous two exercises which required you to format each word or phrase like `"this example",`, this time the `.split` function is used as a shortcut, which allows you to simply separate phrases in the array with a comma.

Once you have finished these exercises, be sure to click TOOLS -> IMPORT/EXPORT -> EXPORT TO GITHUB then put in your username/repositoryname to push your changes to your GitHub repository. Then, once in GitHub, view that repository and follow the green buttons: COMPARE & PULL REQUEST, CREATE PULL REQUEST, MERGE PULL REQUEST, CONFIRM MERGE.

Next we will publish our code on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site).
