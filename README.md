## Before Week 1

Read (on top of the weekly readings):
1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
3. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
4. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

Familiarise yourself with the following student resources as well as the Student Charter:

# Week 1 - for use in class

## Questions

### Digital Writing

- What do you think digital writing is?
- What do you expect from the digital writing lab?

### Your Writing

- What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?
- What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
- Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?
- How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?

### Electronic Literature

- Defining e-lit
- [The Electronic Literature Collections](https://collection.eliterature.org/)
- [Woollahra Digital Literary Award](https://www.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/Library/Digital-literary-award)
  
### Reading

Read a few works from each volume of the [Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/):

* [Volume 1 (October 2006)](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/)
* [Volume 2 (February 2011)](https://collection.eliterature.org/2/)
* [Volume 3 (February 2016)](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/)
* [Volume 4 (June 2022)](https://collection.eliterature.org/4/)

Select one work from each volume that you read and for each write:

* What makes the work a piece of digital writing
* A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel &c)

## GitHub

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Do the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Digital Writing Folio

Create a public repository with a `README` called `digital-writing-folio`.

On the main page of the repository you will see a button called "Add file".

1. Select "Add file"
2. Select "Create new file" from the dropdown that appears
3. At the top where you can see "Name your file..." type in `readings.md`
4. Scroll down to the bottom and select "Commit new file"
5. Repeat the above steps to add `exercises.md`

Look at the [example digital writing folio](https://github.com/blidau/digital-writing-folio). This should give you an idea of what the folio should initially look like.

On the example digital writing folio click on the "README.md". You should see a button that looks like "<>" just above the content. Select that button to see the formatting on the page. You can follow this technique for all the pages if you need to see the formatting used. Also read the reference for [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Edit the `exercises.md` page you just created in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions, you answered earlier.

## Write a Bio Note

Write a 100-word biographical note. Use the questions you answered above as starting points. Add the biographical note to the `README.md` of your GitHub digital writing folio repository.

## Intro to the Coding Playground

- Create an account on [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/) using your GitHub login credentials
- Remix this code: [https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground)

# Week 2 - for use in class

This Wednesday we will be working in the [coding playground](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/dw-coding-playground) that you began to remix last week. 

If you missed out on the first week of classes, please make sure that you have set up a GitHub account, have signed into Glitch.com using your GitHub credentials so that the accounts are linked, that you follow the exercises including Hello, World! and setting up your Digital Writing folio as explained above, that you're familiar with the documentation in this class GitHub repository (including the class handbook and assessments) and are up to date on the class readings (link in handbook).

In class this week we will learn step-by-step how to make changes to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You will learn to import fonts of your choosing into the stylesheet; how to edit text, emojis and images; how to set background colours and apply various style changes. You will also learn how to edit textual arrays in order to fuel combinatory poetry which is pseudo-randomly generated.

Here are some miscellaneous resources that you will find helpful as we code today:

- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Hex colour codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/) 
- Check if your [colour contrast is accessible](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- [Royalty-free images](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Emojis](https://tools.picsart.com/text/emojis/)
- [GIFs](https://giphy.com/)
- [ChatGPT for troubleshooting code](https://chat.openai.com/)
