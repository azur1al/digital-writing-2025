## Before Week 1

Read (on top of the weekly readings):
1. The kinetic poem ["Taroko Gorge"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=taroko-gorge)
2. The electronic poem ["The Gathering Cloud"](https://luckysoap.com/thegatheringcloud/)
3. The hypertext fiction ["First Draft of the Revolution"](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=first-draft-of-the-revolution)
4. The interactive fiction work ["Shade"](https://pr-if.org/play/shade/)

"Shade" is much more difficult to interact with so do read the "How to play IF" (link in the top right corner of "Shade") and look at the ["Play IF card"](https://pr-if.org/doc/play-if-card/).

Select one work from each volume that you read and for each write:

* What makes the work a piece of digital writing
* A personal response (whether you liked it, how it made you feel &c)

## GitHub

1. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
2. Do the ["Hello World" exercise](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

## Digital Writing Folio

Create a public repository with a `README` called `digital-writing-folio`.

On the main page of the repository you will see a button called "Add file".

1. Select "Add file"
2. Select "Create new file" from the dropdown that appears
3. At the top where you can see "Name your file..." type in `readings.md`
4. Scroll down to the bottom and select "Commit new file"
5. Repeat the above steps to add `exercises.md`

Look at the [example digital writing folio](https://github.com/blidau/digital-writing-folio). This should give you an idea of what the folio should initially look like.

On the example digital writing folio click on the "README.md". You should see a button that looks like "<>" just above the content. Select that button to see the formatting on the page. You can follow this technique for all the pages if you need to see the formatting used. Also read the reference for [basic writing and formatting syntax on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Edit the `exercises.md` page you just created in your digital writing folio and add the following questions with your answers to the questions, you answered earlier.

## Write a Bio Note

Write a 100-word biographical note. Use the questions you answered above as starting points. Add the biographical note to the `README.md` of your GitHub digital writing folio repository.
