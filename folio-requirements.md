# Assessment 3 - Folio Requirements

The folio demonstrates your experimentation and engagement with the form during the class. It needs to address the criteria as outlined in the class handbook:

1. Objectives
   - All the required professional documents are present
   - Documentation of any changes between the proposal and the developed creative work
   - Coversheet for the developed creative work is complete
   - Success of the creative work in meeting the proposal or documented revised objectives 
2. Evidence
   - Folio contains a wide range of exercises
   - Quality of the developed creative work
3. Annotations
   - Critical engagement with works of electronic literature that were read and discussed in class
   - Critical engagement with the readings
   - Developed creative work as a critical engagement with the form 
4. Reflection
   - Your artist statement
   - Reflection on the class and how your practice has developed
   - Reflections on the class exercises
   - Reflection on the developed creative work
5. Presentation
   - Presentation of the folio
   - Presentation of the developed creative work
6. Referencing
   - Consistent referencing

Ensure that you read the [digital writing folio assessment description in the class handbook](./class-handbook.md).

Try to capture as much as you can in your folio. If you had a few iterations of your final project or experimented with techniques you did not use in your final piece; the folio is the place to record this with reflections and/or links to the experiments.

For the submission to Canvas, the PDF document should include:

- Your name
- An artist statement (if this is already included in an artist CV or your website or GitHub repository, still have it here, but it can be the same).
- A 500-word reflection on the class and how your practice has developed (if this is included in your GitHub digital writing folio, still have it here too).
- An link to your artist website that serves as a CV (e.g. artist bio and publications).
- A link to your GitHub account and your digital writing folio GitHub repository. Your folio repository should have links to your digital experiments completed in class and short reflections on those experiments, and reflections on key readings as outlined in the README.me file in this respository. 
- Screenshots and working links to your digital experiments, including: the coding playground where you have edited each of the poems and applied styling changes, your remixed "To Make a Dadaist Poem", and a Twine game that at a minimum has a working image map which links to passages. Optionally, you may include links to Bitsy and Inform games.
- Additional pages to your submission document, which include your reflections on your community of practice and experiences workshopping your creative project if these are not included in your folio repository on GitHub.
- Any documentation on the development of your creative work with any scans of any designs and notes.
- [Coversheet for your developed creative work](./coversheet-for-developed-creative-work.md)

Please note that when submitting your PDF document through Canvas, the max page count for your submission is 30 pages. We will not assess work beyond this limit, however, we will be combing through your GitHub repositories for your reflections, code and other evidence of engagement. Make good use of your repositories `.ReadMe` files if you want to leave us notes explaining the purpose of the repo. Use the 30 pages to cover the required information as set out above, but also use it to capture any other highlights of your learning experience: screenshots of Miro maps, scans of your ideation process from your journals, iterations and breakthroughs.
